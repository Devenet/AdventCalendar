## Picture per days

### Add pictures

Put your photos in the `private/` folder, and name them with the number of the day you want to illustrate.
For example, for the 1st December, call your file `1.jpg` or `1.jpeg`.  

__Be sure that the access to `private` folder is forbidden when browsing it!__   
For Apache configuration, be sure that a `.htaccess` file with the directive `deny from all` is in and read.

### Customize legend and title

To add a title, a legend or a text on a day page, just rename `calendar.example.json` in folder `private` in `calendar.json` and add what you want to display.

For example:

```json
{
        "1": {
                "title": "First day of December",
                "legend": "Paris, November 2013",
                "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [...]."
        },
        "2": {
                "legend": "Berlin, March 2013"
        },
        "6": {
                "title": "Saint Nicholas Day"
        },
        "12": {
                "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [...]."
        }
}
```
