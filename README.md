Then edit the `settings.json` file to configure the application and set the year – or [generate settings file](https://web.devenet.eu/advent/generator/#settings) and put it in the `private` folder.

To finish, just put your image files in the `private` folder; images named with the number of the day (such as `1.jpeg`, `2.jpg`, `3.png`).  
Supported formats are: JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF.

### Full available options

| Property | Type | Description |

| __`title`__ | string | __Required__ Set the title of your AdventCalendar |
| __`background`__ | string | Set to `alternate` to use an alternative background image |

    "site_id": "12345"
  },
  "disclaimer": "All content is under Creative Commons BY-NC 3.0 licence."
}
```

### Transform AdventCalendar into CountDownCalendar

If you want, you can also customize month, first day and last day which are used to display the period of days, but it's not really an AdventCalendar anymore ;-)

Just change the period with those 3 options:
```json
{
  "month": 3,
  "first_day": 8,
  "last_day": 31
}
```

## Picture per days

### Add pictures

Put your photos in the `private/` folder, and name them with the number of the day you want to illustrate.
For example, for the 1st December, call your file `1.jpg` or `1.jpeg`.  

Supported formats are: JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF.

__Be sure that the access to `private` folder is forbidden when browsing it!__   
For Apache configuration, be sure that a `.htaccess` file with the directive `deny from all` is in and read.

### Customize legend and title

To add a title, a legend or a text on a day page, just rename `calendar.example.json` in folder `private` in `calendar.json` and add what you want to display.

For example:

```json
{
  "6": {
    "title": "Saint Nicholas Day",
    "legend": "Berlin, March 2013",
    "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [...]."
  }
}
```

## Oups, problems?

- __All days are shown before Christmas:__ Check the syntax in `settings.json` or update the year.
- __Photo is not displayed:__ Be sure your photo is correctly named, like `3.jpg` or `12.jpeg` with the supported formats.
- __Title, legend or text are not displayed:__ Check the syntax of your `calendar.json` file.
- __Day is shown in late or advance:__ Configure the timezone of your server.
