## General settings

Put a JSON file called `settings.json` in your root folder with these information:

```json
{
  "title": "my Advent Calendar",
  "year": 2013
}

If you want to use the alternate background, add a line (do not forget to add a coma at the end of the  previous line):

```json
  "background": "alternate"
```
